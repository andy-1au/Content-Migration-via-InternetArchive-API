# InternetArchive
These scripts utilize Internet Archive's API to download certain files uploaded by Lehigh's Special Collections Library to our local database for a more efficient access.
The rest of the code is mostly file + filename manipulation to match certain parameters when uploading it to our local database/websites. This is why there are CSV files and what not
I have commented certain parts of the code to describe what each section does. 
If you want to use the code, feel free to do so and contact me @ andyolau888@gmail.com or just comment on some of my work if you have any questions.
